# Design Patterns and Best Practices in Java - Packt - 2018

"Behavioral patterns focus on object interaction, communication, and control flows.
 Most behavioral patterns are based on composition and delegation rather than inheritance."

# Wikipedia

"Behavioral design patterns identify common communication patterns among objects.
 By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out communication."

"Behavioral design patterns describe the way objects and classes interact and divide responsibilities among themselves.
 A behavioral pattern abstracts an action you want to take from the object or class that takes the action.
 By changing the object or class, you can change the algorithm used, the objects affected, or the behavior, while still retaining the same basic interface for client classes."
